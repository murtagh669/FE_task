# Explain some things

I didn't add types everywhere due to time. Using the type " any " is a rather bad pattern because it causes us to have very weak types instead of strong ones, which makes using TS and any have zero effect.
Additionally, TypeScript introduces elements such as interfaces, abstract classes and decorators, which make the code clearer and easier to maintain.
Regarding architecture - I'm not a specialist in Vue architecture, I've seen a few suggestions on the Internet, but I don't want to force something without some knowledge.
